== Preparing your Computer

Building a project like Apache PLC4X on multiple target operating-systems is quite a challenge, but I think we managed to make it as simple as possible.

However when building PLC4X there are some requirements the build is expecting you to have provided.
However this greatly depends on which parts you want to build.
The `Java` modules hereby probably have the least demanding requirements.

In order to build at all you are required to have `Java 8` installed on your machine.

TIP: We have tested the build with Java 8 up to Java 13 (Latest version at the time of writing this document).

If a new version comes out, please give us a little time to verify and handle any related issues.
We'll probably fix them as soon as possible.
However in the past with Oracle's new release strategy, there have been a few bumps on the road.
