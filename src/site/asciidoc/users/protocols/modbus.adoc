=== Individual Resource Address Format

In contrast to most other protocols Modbus only supports two datatypes.

- Bit (Coil)
- Short (2-bytes) (Registers)

Some implementations implement more types based on these, such as 16 bit half-precision floating point types wrapped in a Register or joining multiple Coils or Registers to bigger data-types, but this is not handled by the Modbus specification.

Coils and Registers are generally separated into pure inputs which are read-only and writable versions.

Inputs (Read-Only):

- Discrete Input (Boolean / 1 bit)
- Input Register (Short / 16 bit)

Output (Read/Write):

- Coil (Boolean / 1 bit)
- Holding Register (Short / 16 bit)

Extended Registers (6x) - Function Code 20 - (Short / 16 bit)

These are able to be referenced as a continuous data area 600000 - 699999. Internally this is converted to the file number/register format. File number 1 corresponds to the first 10000 registers (600000 - 609999), file number 2 the next 10000 (610000 - 619999) and so on.

Note unlike the other areas this area starts at address 0.

At the moment this implementation only supports reading the extended memory area.

Here come the syntax descriptions of these addresses (Each address can reference either a single item or an array):

|===
|Name |Address Syntax |Description |Bit-Size

|Discrete Input   |`discrete-input:{start-address}` or `discrete-input:{start-address}[{count}]` or `1{start-address}` or `1{start-address}[{count}]` or `1x{start-address}` or `1x{start-address}[{count}]`   |Read-only Boolean input value, usually representing a binary input to the PLC |1
|Input Register   |`input-register:{start-address}` or `input-register:{start-address}[{count}]` or `3{start-address}` or `3{start-address}[{count}]` or `3x{start-address}` or `3x{start-address}[{count}]`   |Read-only Short input value, usually representing an analog input to the PLC  |16
|Coil             |`coil:{start-address}` or `coil:{start-address}[{count}]` or `0{start-address}` or `0{start-address}[{count}]` or `0x{start-address}` or `0x{start-address}[{count}]`             |Read/Write Boolean value, usually representing a binary output from the PLC   |1
|Holding Register |`holding-register:{start-address}` or `holding-register:{start-address}[{count}]` or `4{start-address}` or `4{start-address}[{count}]` or `4x{start-address}` or `4x{start-address}[{count}]` |Read/Write Short value, usually representing an analog output from the PLC    |16
|Extended Register |`extended-register:{start-address}` or `extended-register:{start-address}[{count}]` or `6{start-address}` or `6{start-address}[{count}]` or `6x{start-address}` or `6x{start-address}[{count}]` |Read/Write Short value,    |16
